# Socket Example Code

This code was created as part of the UGA 1730 class. We explored sockets in class and the teacher gave us an extra assignment to finish up the socket example at home. This was my implementation.

## Running the Code

To run the code, first compile with g++ or gcc. Then, run the server first using ./socketserv and then the client using ./socketcli. It is recommended you start the server before starting the client.
